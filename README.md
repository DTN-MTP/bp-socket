# Bp-socket

Bp-socket is a project designed to tackle a core DTN problem: providing a clean, interoperable API to facilitate application developers in sending data using the Bundle Protocol (BP).

The core objective of this project is to extend the Linux networking stack by introducing a new address family specifically for BP communication. The new address family, `BP_AF`, offers a protocol abstraction that aligns with the **Interplanetary Networking (IPN) Scheme Naming and Addressing**.

Bp-socket consists of two key components:

1. **Kernel Module**: Provides a kernel-level abstraction for DTN communication with IPN scheme.
2. **User-Space Daemon**: Acts as a pass-through service, facilitating communication between the kernel and the ION (Interplanetary Overlay Network) daemon, which handles the actual BP processing.

## Architecture

The resulting ‚ÄúBP Sockets‚Äù interface integrates with bundle protocol stacks in user space. Netlink IPC (Inter-Process Communication) coordinates kernel and user space interactions. The main elements of the architecture are described below.

![Architecture](./docs/img/architecture.png)

<details close>
<summary>Application</summary>
<br>
The user application creates a socket with a newly introduced address family 28, with the datagram (DGRAM) type and protocol number 0. The destination EID is provided via the sockaddr parameter of the sendto() function, and the Application Data Unit (ADU) to be conveyed via BP is provided in the message field.
<br><br>
</details>

<details close>
<summary>Kernel Module</summary>
<br>
A kernel module processes BP Sockets calls. This module uses Netlink to deliver the bundle payload and related metadata to the BP Sockets Daemon. Netlink is a communication protocol between the Linux kernel and userspace processes designed for asynchronous message passing.
<br><br>
</details>

<details close>
<summary>Daemon</summary>
<br>
Upon receiving a message, the BP Sockets Daemon in userspace retrieves the EID and the ADU, creates a bundle with ION, and sends it to the peer. In our case, the destination was running ¬µD3TN on a second virtual machine (VM). This way, we demonstrated interoperability between ¬µD3TN and ION using the BP Sockets interface.  Note that the BP Sockets Daemon is modular and not locked to ION; it could easily be adapted to another Bundle Protocol implementation.

</details>

## Outcome

It was demonstrated by transmitting bundles from a minimal user space application through the Linux kernel and ION to ¬µD3TN using BP Sockets. The screenshot below shows the ¬µD3TN log (the receiving BP node) on the top, the BP Sockets App sender on the bottom left, and the BP App receiver output on the bottom right.

## Prerequisites

Choose one of the supported environments:

### For Linux (Vagrant)

- RSync
- Libvirt (and QEMU)
- [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads)
- [Vagrant Libvirt](https://vagrant-libvirt.github.io/vagrant-libvirt/)

### For macOS (Multipass)

- [Multipass](https://canonical.com/multipass) >= 1.15
- macOS interface `en0` (Wi-Fi) must support bridged mode via vmnet.framework

## Getting started

To set up the development environment described in the [Architecture](#architecture) section, you must:

1. Choose your platform: either follow [Linux Setup (Vagrant)](#linux-setup-vagrant) or [macOS Setup (Multipass)](#macos-setup-multipass).

2. Then complete the [Preparing `ion-node` and `ud3tn-node`](#preparing-ion-node-and-ud3tn-node).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:
> It is highly recommended to use `ion-node` (VM1) as your development environment. This VM already includes the necessary tools and dependencies. By working directly on VM1, you can simplify testing and avoid additional setup on your local machine.
> In both the Linux and macOS setups, your local project directory is automatically synced to the `/bp-socket` path inside the ion-node VM.

### Linux Setup (Vagrant)

1. Create the virtual machines

Start both VMs with:

```bash
vagrant up
```

2. Enable automatic file synchronization on `ion-node`

To keep your local `bp-socket` project synced with the `/vagrant` directory on `ion-node`, run:

```bash
vagrant rsync-auto
```

> Make sure to keep this process running in a separate terminal during development.

3. Interact with the VMs

Use the following commands to connect:

```bash
vagrant ssh ion
vagrant ssh ud3tn
```

### macOS Setup (Multipass)

If you're using macOS, you can reproduce the virtual lab setup described above using [Multipass](https://canonical.com/multipass) and `cloud-init` instead of Vagrant. This approach uses QEMU with manual network configuration and provides an easy way to launch both `ion-node` and `ud3tn-node`.

1. Launch `ion-node`

```zsh
multipass launch 24.04 \
  --name ion-node \
  --cpus 4 \
  --memory 2G \
  --disk 10G \
  --timeout 1800 \
  --mount $PWD:/bp-socket \
  --network name=en0,mode=manual,mac="52:54:00:4b:ab:cd" \
  --cloud-init configs/cloud-init/ion.cloud-config.cfg
```

This command:

- Assigns a static MAC address to the VM
- Mounts the project directory at `/bp-socket` inside the VM
- Applies the `cloud-init` config to provision packages, IP setup, and kernel modules

2. Launch `ud3tn-node`

```zsh
multipass launch 24.04 \
  --name ud3tn-node \
  --cpus 2 \
  --memory 1G \
  --disk 10G \
  --timeout 1800 \
  --network name=en0,mode=manual,mac="52:54:00:4b:ab:cf" \
  --cloud-init configs/cloud-init/ud3tn.cloud-config.cfg
```

3. Interact with the VMs

Use the following commands to connect:

```zsh
multipass shell ion-node
multipass shell ud3tn-node
```

> üí° **Note**: You can check assigned IPs using `ip a` inside the VMs. Your cloud-init file should have configured static IP addresses (192.168.50.10 for `ion-node` and 192.168.50.20 for `ud3tn-node`) on interface enp0s1.

### Preparing `ion-node` and `ud3tn-node`

<details open>
<summary><strong>ud3tn-node</strong></summary>

a) SSH into `ud3tn-node` and start the uD3TN process:

```bash
# SSH into ud3tn-node before
sudo -i
cd /opt/ud3tn/
build/posix/ud3tn \
    --allow-remote-config \
    --eid ipn:20.0 \
    --aap2-socket ./ud3tn.aap2.socket.2 \
    --cla "tcpclv3:*,4556" -L 4
```

b) Then, in another terminal, add an outgoing contact to the ION node:

```bash
# SSH into ud3tn-node before
sudo -i

```

b) Build and insert the **Bundle Protocol (BP)** kernel module:

```bash
cd /bp-socket/src/kernel
make
insmod bp.ko
```

c) Build and launch the userspace daemon:
